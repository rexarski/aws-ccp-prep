B wrong, C correct.
A pay-as-you-go model reduces investments in large capital expenditures. In addition, you can reduce the operating expense (OpEx) costs involved with the management and maintenance of data. This frees up budget, allowing you to quickly act on innovative initiatives that canâ€™t be easily pursued when managing CapEx. https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/total-cost-of-operation-benefits-using-aws.pdf

E is correct but not relevant in this question. It's a feature, but not financial benefit? https://aws.amazon.com/activate/

## Q10

The Cost & Usage Report is your one-stop-shop for accessing the most granular data about your AWS costs and usage. You can also load your cost and usage information into Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, AWS QuickSight, or a tool of your choice.
Reference:
https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/

A is almost at the same level of C.

A actually support hourly cost now. https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/aws-cost-explorer-supports-hourly-resource-level-granularity/

It's hard to say A or C. C is more detailed in quantity, A is more detailed in time.

I vote for C though.
